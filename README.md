# Advent of Code 2021

These are my suboptimal solutions for this years advent of code, where I had some fun learning the language [K](https://shakti.com). K is known for its extreme terseness combined with syntactic simplicity which makes writing code very unconventional and fun. Reading can be less fun though.

I used the great, still-evolving free implementation [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k) (tested with 2fe4ae153c) to run my code.
